# Counselling-Demonstration
For getting admission into colleges across India we need to fill counselling forms and do choice filling. Many students don't know how college is allocated in it and sometimes do wrong choice filling. This project is made with the purpose that whoever use this C++ Program they can easily understand the working behind counselling in a abstract manner. 

Note: This Program may only work in Windows because since C++ is machine dependent (some dependencies especially for windows are used.) Also plese use GCC Compiler for running the program.
